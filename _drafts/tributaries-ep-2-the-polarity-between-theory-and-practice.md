### About the Tributaries Series

As a way of encouraging the practice of writing, we decided to lower the stakes, remove dependencies, and create mutual accountability. We agree to a prompt, a deadline, a word count (500), and a level of polish (write what comes to mind and ship what you write). That's it. Enjoy!

### Episode 3: The Purpose of 1:1s

#### Chris' Answer

1:1s have lifecycles. They evolve and change as the situation the two participants are in changes. New managers coming into existing teams will have very different 1:1s than teams formed through time or from the ether.

So, when I talk about the purpose of a 1:1, I tend to go pretty high-level as to avoid the needs of particular points in time in favor of generically valid purpose.

In a nutshell, 1:1s are about building relationships. All of the advice geared towards the more powerful member of the pair basically boils down to “don’t steamroll the less powerful member of the pair.” This is good advice. You certainly can’t build a healthy relationship on bullying. I’d argue that this is table stakes. We’ve found that most people succeed at losing rather than failing to win, so we focus on the things not to do, but I don’t see much advice on what to do.

Do:

* Be a person
* Contribute
* Make space for the other person whenever they want it
* Ask about what is important to the other person
* Follow-up on things talked about

As a manager, you carry baggage that makes folks hesitant to open up.

Power

Lack of

Enter cogency:

The purpose of 1:1s is spending high-quality time with someone you want to work with productively. Spending time with someone is the only way to build a healthy relationship with them. There’s no fast-track to interpersonal success, but there are things to make sure the time you’re spending is time towards, and not away from, that goal.

Think about the people you choose to spend time with: friends, partners, coworkers. How would you characterize those interactions? Now contrast that with many of the one-on-one interactions that happen between direct reports and the people whom they report to. Where do they differ?

It’s forced:

The clearest predictor of a bad 1:1 in the making is that one party or the other doesn’t want to be there. Friends you don’t enjoy spending time with rapidly become acquaintances. In a work setting you’re effectively trapped with folks. That means distance relationships result in awkward and ineffective communication patterns and not much long-term good.

So, you want a better 1:1. Cool.

* Be a person
* Contribute where appropriate
* Make space for the other person whenever they want it
* Ask about what is important to the other person in and out of work
* Follow-up on things they say they care about

These tips apply to every interaction you ever have with another human.

There’s no magical reason why 1:1s are a key to success. There’s a mundane one.

Managers tend to say no to obligations too rarely, and thus are starved for time. Without “free” time, they tend not to talk with the folks who report to them unless there’s a need. You know that friend you only hear from when they need something? Don’t be that person. The power dynamic allows you to go a long, long time without realizing that folks loathe interacting with you. 1:1s are a cadenced approach to preventing that through spending time on what matters–the people.

Now that we’re focused on relationship building, let’s pick apart some of the guidance we give managers.

No injection.

Time reqs.

Structure.

#### Alastair's Answer

Let’s define our terms. While any meeting between two people could be considered a “one on one”, the 1-1 we’re talking about is a recurring meeting between a manager and one of their direct reports. To understand the purpose of a 1-1, we have to understand the context. A manager <> direct report relationship is predicated by definition on a power imbalance; a manager is a manager in virtue of their power over their direct reports.

Along with that structural power almost always comes a conventional understanding of what it is to be a manager. Managers direct, they supervise, they know better, they make sure the work happens. All of these ingredients add up to a dynamic in which the manager _decides_. They decide what’s important, what needs to be discussed, where the focus and attention need to be.

The purpose of a 1-1 is for the manager to use their power to create a space in which their direct report gets to decide what’s important (what most needs to be discussed, and how) and a space in which they believe it’s safe–appreciated, in fact–to share those things. Being vulnerable takes an investment of energy, of trust, of courage, and adding a power imbalance into the mix only increases that cost. Without a space where it’s explicit (and structurally validated) that the direct report gets to ordain a topic the most important and relevant thing to discuss–where it’s genuinely treated as most important by _both_ people–the conversation will default to whatever the pair implicitly believes the manager feels is most important. The fears, frustrations, questions, insights, and brilliant ideas that the direct report could surface given the right environment stay buried until they shrivel and starve (ideas) or fester until it’s too late to resolve them.

To accomplish this explicit permission and structural validation of the direct report’s ownership over what’s discussed, the manager must use their power to mark a boundary, a boundary in which the implications of that power are diminished. Because that power dynamic is still there (and will always be there), this space must be created and held so that the direct report’s power to decide isn’t undermined. The 1-1 _must_ be _their_ space to fill.
