### About the Tributaries Series

As a way of encouraging the practice of writing, we decided to lower the stakes, remove dependencies, and create mutual accountability. We agree to a prompt, a deadline, a word count (500), and a level of polish (write what comes to mind and ship what you write). That's it. Enjoy!

### Episode 2: The Polarity Between Theory and Practice

#### Alastair's Answer

As with most polarities, theory and practice are often taken to be two independent, distinct ‚Äúthings‚Äù, each with its own dogma and acolytes. What‚Äôs the difference, though, really? Any moment of practice is the application of theory. ‚ÄúPractice‚Äù implies a certain intentionality; this isn‚Äôt just gut reactions or instinct. It follows, then, that practice is the result of a decision (or several), and those decisions must be guided by theory.

Sure, in some cases the theories in play may be explicit and conscious and in others they may be implicit and/or subconscious. It might be helpful to think of these theories as mental models. Any time you‚Äôre doing something ‚Äúin practice‚Äù, you‚Äôre doing it informed by one or more mental models you‚Äôve formed that represent the relevant parts of reality. If you overhaul your organizational incentives and structures to align with self-determination theory? That‚Äôs practice informed by theory. If you attach contingent monetary compensation to something you want more of (because ‚Äúpeople are motivated by money‚Äù), that‚Äôs practice informed by theory.

So, what are we really talking about when we talk about the polarity of theory and practice? Going back to the theory vs. practice false dichotomy we talked about earlier, we can form an idea of each from the view of the other. ‚ÄúTheory‚Äù is academic positing done in a disconnected, unrealistic bubble of hypotheticals. Sure, theory sounds good within its own contexts (university classrooms, academic journals, and super-niche conference talks) but it falls flat when taken out of its hermetically sealed birthplace.

Practice, on the other hand, is a bunch of uninformed cowboys doing what‚Äôs always been done and perpetuating an endless mishmash of ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù, many of which have been proven via rigorous study to be either ineffectual or actually harmful‚Ä¶decades ago.

Maybe, then, the polarity is thinking and doing. You can‚Äôt just think (you‚Äôd never get anything done!) and you can‚Äôt just do (you‚Äôll never learn, never improve, and may well stumble onto a landmine). They must be balanced, held in dynamic tension. But what does _that_ mean?

To start, it means questioning and answering. Questioning helps keep the balance from moving too far towards doing; being curious about our current understanding, about what beliefs and attitudes are underpinning what actions we choose to take enables learning. Answering here means _application_. It means going out into the real world and _trying stuff_ to see what we can learn. It means taking action and putting thought into practice, but in a way that enables the uncovering of deeper, richer questions.

It also means taking advantage of the questioning and answering being done by others. Who else is asking similar questions and what answers are they finding? The key here is to recognize that the questions others are asking are _always_ different than our own questions. The difference is context. We might think we‚Äôre asking ‚Äúwhat motivates people?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow can people best work together?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow can work be meaningful?‚Äù but for those of us walking that theory-practice polarity, there‚Äôs always a ‚Äúhere‚Äù tacked on the end.

#### Chris' Answer

Polarities are conflicts where domination by one contingent dooms all involved to brittle stagnation followed by upheaval. Polarities are managed, not won. They aren't problems to be solved through absolutist rhetoric. They are balances to be struck. Opposites which benefit from the other's existence and influence. Opposites which cannot meaningfully survive without the other.

I struggle to make the transition into treating theory and practice as poles through the lens above. Surely, practice survives throughout the world without theory informing the behaviors manifest? I think not. What we see today is a world of craft. A world informed by the practices of the past. Those practices augmented by the theories of practitioners over the years. People are behaving with theory informed practices, but those theories are not necessarily for the contexts in which they are being used.

So there's the meat of this, then. The tension between theory and practice is produced by the volatility of the domain in play. Practice without theory is a blind stumble through the world cursing the gods for not honoring your strict adherence to the rituals agreed upon by your forebears. Theory without practice is ivory tower navel gazing with no sensory apparatus to determine that the world has moved on, and no longer needs your solutions to yesterday's problems. To have theory is to be able to generate adaptive practices. To have practice is to know when you need to adapt. These cannot exist in isolation.

In modern life, the volatility of the world is increasing exponentially. The first order optimal solution is to be in motion. Steer constantly to surf the thermals of change. Second order, we start to think about what we should be steering towards. Maybe it's better to shed energy rather than build it to prepare to catch the big one. Third order, we think about why we want to have energy at all. Fourth order, we ask about why we want to be in places. Fifth, what we need to have. Sixth, why we are. Seventh, who we are. Eighth, where we stop and start. Ninth, what is the other. Tenth, why is otherness. And we continue to go down this rabbit hole forever without writing anything useful...

To adapt to this changing world, we need to build new practices constantly. To build effective practices quickly, we need design. To design, we need theory. Design is the binder between practice and theory. Design is craft's antithesis. It's minimalist. It's adaptive and not exaptive. Designed processes tend to be brittle because of this. You can combat this with continuous design or by building loosely-constrained processes.

If you loosely-constrain a process, you're basically throwing in the towel on pure design. You're acknowledging that there needs to be flex for people in the system to move outside of your designs. If you go with continuous design, you're constantly going to have to sample the functioning of the system on a deep level and adjust. This requires reams of information about how things are operating and what the possibilities are. Ashby's Law comes into play. Human tolerance for change comes into play. _Play_ comes into play. The only way for continuous design to be sustainable is through play. A sufficiently high proportion of the players must be _live_ players reveling in the game of systems design. This amplifies the knowledge burden geometrically. Now, your live actors need to be sharing their info, synthesizing, observing the system, marketing to the _dead_ players... It's a lot. It's chaotic and beautiful and...nearly impossible to scale.

Volatility and scale. One tends towards theory. The other towards practice. Both demand a balance to be struck, but different ones. ü§î
