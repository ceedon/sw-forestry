### Intro to the Tributaries Series

As a way of encouraging the practice of writing, we decided to lower the stakes, remove dependencies, and create mutual accountability. We agree to a prompt, a deadline, a word count (500), and a level of polish (write what comes to mind and ship what you write).

We find value in being able to (quickly) form individual takes on a particular topic, compare and contrast those perspectives, and only then start building a shared understanding.

So, with the ceremony it deserves: here's the thing. That's it. Enjoy.

### Episode 1: The impact of Self-Identity on Personal Growth

_Or, How does “I’m an x kind of person” or “I’m someone who does y” affect one’s pursuit of growth?_

#### Chris' Answer

I find this prompt interesting, because I believe the two materialized statements of the question to be at odds. Let's take the two separately.

##### "I'm an _x_ kind of person."

This framing is subjective and governing. There's not really much I can do about directly changing what kind of person I am. I might as well accept this and move on. I will discount paths of study outside of the norm for my group. I will chide myself for failing in any ways my group shouldn't fail. I will constantly be measuring myself against others in my group.

##### "I'm someone who does _y_."

This framing is objective and liberating. I can choose to change what I do. There is no reason to continue to do something I believe to be harmful. I can find alternative ways to interact with the world. I will evaluate how my actions affect my situation and adapt. I am measuring current me against my wishes for future me.

##### Now to answer the question...

Pedantry aside, any framing pushes us into thinking like the former, governing phrase. We're hyper-sensitive to membership in tribes. We intuitively will seek to learn from members of our tribe. The internet makes this exceedingly easy. Reddit is happy to point you towards a community of like-minded, or in this case similarly behaved, individuals.  
This can be super useful. This can be super harmful. Much depends on the mental models and general tenor of thought of the actor. Do they challenge group memberships? Asked another way, "Do they consider _iconoclasts_ to be their premier group?" If they do, perhaps they harvest what learning there is to be had and move on only too happy to buck the norm. If not, the path of least resistance is settling into the mould–I'm an _x_ kind of person.

So, it depends? What do we truly believe? Does being a member of a group preclude us from being a member of an opposed group? Can I use Apple products AND think Nadella's Microsoft is pretty shiny AND love the unopinioned mess that is Android? I think so. Intellectual humility enables us to ignore the boundaries set before us. To build our own group that's a melange of everything we have experienced and internalized. To find our own way. Humility lets us throw aside the plans others, past selves included, have crafted for us to follow and steer instead. It lets us bask in the lovely novelty of the moment without fear or pretense. We can assess what we need to be and become it rather than following the script that _someone like me_ follows.

So, this prompt leaves me with a question. How do we teach people to be self-taught? How can we create a tribe of quirky little miscreants who buck trends as the situation demands? Stoicism has much to say. As does the Tao. As does Buddhism. As does much of Eastern thought. We must stoke the fires of reason, of that I'm sure. Inductive, deductive, but perhaps most importantly in this complex world, abuctive. I hope I'm a cogent kind of person. I hope I'm someone who seeks cogency.

#### Alastair's Answer

I’m going to define self-identity as "who you want to believe you are" or "who you want to believe you can be". It’s important not to conflate those definitions with "who you want to be", although they’re related. The "…you want to believe…" piece is crucial. That’s where the real magic happens.

It’s uncontroversial at this point (thanks, psychology!) to assert that we all have beliefs we protect, beliefs we feel–whether we realize it or not–_must_ be true. It’s the protected nature of these beliefs that makes them so powerful. We’re so intent on preserving them that we’ll bend reality to fit them. In some (many) cases, "bending reality" means bending our perceptions, insisting on seeing what we believe. In other cases, we will do all we can to resolve the cognitive dissonance between belief and reality by shaping reality itself. Both of these cases show up in the pursuit of personal growth.

That former case, when we simply shift our perceptions without even knowing it, is an exquisite way to stand still (or even move backward!) when ostensibly we’re dedicated to our own growth. In some cases, it’s "meta" enough to be almost perversely funny: “Could I have been acting from jealousy in that moment? No way, I’m super self-aware. I’d have known it.” In identifying as a certain type of person–by hitching our ego and self-esteem to that identity–we’re setting ourselves up to be blind to the _very learning opportunities_ that would allow us to make it a reality.

The latter case, on the other hand–when the delta between what we want to believe and the evidence we’re presented with motivates us to shape reality itself–can be a powerful ally in the campaign for self-improvement. There are moments when we’re faced with a choice. Who am I going to be in this moment? Am I going to be the frustrated me or the angry me or the lazy me or the antagonistic me or the whatever me that’s rearing its (my) head? Or, am I going to be the patient me or the thoughtful me or the dedicated me or the self-aware me? If I want to believe _(need to believe)_ that I’m someone who is patient or thoughtful or dedicated or whatever it is, I must show up that way in order to protect that belief.

This whole thing becomes extra-interesting when the identity we want to confirm is the identity of someone who seeks to grow and evolve. Let’s be honest, holding onto a persistent identity to which self-worth is tied is a bit at odds with personal growth. Maybe it helps for the moment, though, to ask, “Is this the way someone dedicated to personal growth would show up? Is that who I’m being right now? If not, how might I be that person, at least for a moment?”

I need five more words.

Damnit! It was including the title. Nailed it!
